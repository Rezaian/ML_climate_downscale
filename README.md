# Weather Forecasting ML Model

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for weather forecasting by comparing and learning from two datasets: low-resolution global climate simulated models and high-resolution empirical (observational) data from weather stations. The goal is to create a model that can adapt regional features to coarser low-resolution global datasets, potentially improving weather prediction when applied to future global climate models.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for climate data
- Implementation of machine learning models (starting with Random Forest)
- Evaluation and visualization of model performance
- Scalable structure for future improvements and additional models

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/rezaian/ML_climate_downscale.git
   cd ML_climate_downscale
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Place your raw data in the `data/raw/` directory.
2. Run data preprocessing scripts:
   ```
   python src/data_processing/preprocess.py
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```
   python src/models/random_forest.py
   ```
4. Visualize results:
   ```
   python src/visualization/plot_results.py
   ```

## Project Structure
